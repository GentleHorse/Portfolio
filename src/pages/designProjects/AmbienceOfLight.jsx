          In his prior artistic endeavor, "Beauty of Time Passing (2023)," the designer undertook the ambitious task of introducing luminosity into interior spaces through the integration of data-driven meteorological landscapes and the strategic manipulation of light dispersion. The intentional use of glass bricks, with their capacity for reflective interplay, served as a conduit for cultivating a symbiotic relationship between the designed environment and the natural world, resulting in a nuanced nature-inspired ambiance within the domestic realm.In his current project, aptly titled "Ambience of Light," the artist remains dedicated to the same overarching goal while adopting a distinct modus operandi. Here, a profound exploration of the materiality intrinsic to wood and glass bricks takes precedence, as the designer endeavors to distill his vision into a more refined yet robust formal language. This deliberate departure from the previous methodology reflects a commitment to simplicity, underscoring a conscientious effort to attain a heightened aesthetic resonance through a judicious consideration of materials and their inherent expressive potential.
